Hello! I'm Alexandre Dufresne-Nappert, but I often go as Alex or MrDNAlex online. I study Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo and am in the Formula Nano club giving me broad opportunities and experiences in chemistry, electronics, lithography, programming, simulations, biology and quantum physics with a focus on the atomic scale. Through my COOPs and personal projects I have experience working in engineering, programming and other technologically reliant fields, which allow me to learn and explore programming, automation and simulation topics all the time.

- I study at the University of Waterloo.
- I'm working on a solar power boosting polymer film and automation projects.
- I'm learning about MEMS, lithography, programming, automation and simulations.
- Ask me about games, automation or nanotech!
- Reach me through [a3dufres@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:a3dufres@uwaterloo.ca).
- Fun fact : I'm fluently bilingual in both French and English.

I started programming 10 years ago in my high school robotics club using C for Vex IQ, since then I've learnt many languages and tech stacks through personal projects and work experiences. I primarily program in C# or TypeScript and use .NET, Unity, Docker, CUDA and the Discord API as my primary technologies for personal projects or work experiences.

In 2023, I got the opportunity to start a business through the Entrepreneurship-COOP program at the University of Waterloo, since then I've programed and published my projects through the Nano-DNA-Studios GitHub organization. The projects I am most proud of are hosted there such as :
- [GitHubSelfRunner](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/GitHubSelfRunner) : My self hosted alternative to GitHub Actions.
- Audio Visualizer Tool : CUDA/C++ tool for creating "Monstercat style" audio visualized music videos.
- [Class Backup Website](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Class-Backup-Website) : Self hosted website storing class content backups.
- Discord Bots ([Discorca](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Class-Backup-Website), [Factorio-Server-Bot](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Factorio-Server-Bot), [Palworld-Server-Bot](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Palworld-Server-Bot))
- [RocketLeagueReplayParser](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/RocketLeagueReplayParserCLI) : CLI tool that can extract info from Rocket League replays for data/game analysis.
- Mobile Apps (IOS and Android) ([Neural Network Experiments](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/NeuralNetworkExperiments), [Music App](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Music_App), [Wordle Cheater](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/OrdleCheater))
- And many more projects, games and libraries.
