Hello! My name is Alexandre Dufresne-Nappert, but I often go by MrDNAlex online.

I am a Nanotechnology Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. While I study in this engineering program, I have a huge interest in programming.

You can reach me through my school email at a3dufres@uwaterloo.ca, or through my personal at Mr.DNAlex.2003@gmail.com

Check out some of my other code in the NanoDNA Studios organization [NanoDNA Studios](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios).
