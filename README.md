# Intro
Hello! My name is Alexandre Dufresne-Nappert, but I often go by MrDNAlex online.

I am a Nanotechnology Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. While I study in this engineering program, I have a huge interest in programming.

I tend to spend a lot of my free time coding. Like a lot a lot.

# Organization
During my e-COOP I started my business as a Game Dev Studio called NanoDNA Studios.

2 years beforehand I have started developping apps for publishing and I have now decided to bundle a lot of my sharable apps, projects and code under the business.

Code from any of my major Apps and Projects can be accessed through the Organization [NanoDNA Studios](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios).

# Noteworthy Projects
While it is hard for me to pick some of my favourite projects since a lot of them would consider great and defining an era in my programming growth, if I had to narrow down a list of top 5 they would be as Follows

## [Neural Network Experiments](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/NeuralNetworkExperiments) · [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NanoDNA.NeuralNetworkExperiments&pcampaignid=web_share) · [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/neural-network-experiments/id6447320657) · (Unity / C# / HLSL (High Level Shader Language)

❖ Simple app displaying my neural networks. Uses C# Neural Network Library I developed.
