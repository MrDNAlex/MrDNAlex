Hello! I'm Alexandre Dufresne-Nappert, but I often go as Alex or MrDNAlex online. I study Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo and am in the Formula Nano club giving me broad opportunities and experiences in chemistry, electronics, lithography, programming, simulations, biology and quantum physics with a focus on the atomic scale. Through my COOPs and personal projects I have experience working in engineering, programming and other technologically reliant fields, which allow me to learn and explore programming, automation and simulation topics all the time.

- I study at the University of Waterloo.
- I'm working on a solar power boosting polymer film and automation projects.
- I'm learning about MEMS, lithography, programming, automation and simulations.
- Ask me about games, automation or nanotech!
- Reach me through [a3dufres@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:a3dufres@uwaterloo.ca).
- Fun fact : I'm fluently bilingual in both French and English.

I started programming 10 years ago in my high school robotics club using C for Vex IQ, since then I've learnt many languages and tech stacks through personal projects and work experiences. I primarily program in C# or TypeScript and use .NET, Unity, Docker, CUDA and the Discord API as my primary technologies for personal projects or work experiences.

In 2023, I got the opportunity to start a business through the Entrepreneurship-COOP program at the University of Waterloo, since then I've programed and published my projects through the Nano-DNA-Studios GitHub organization. The projects I am most proud of are hosted there such as :
- [GitHubSelfRunner](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/GitHubSelfRunner) : My self hosted alternative to GitHub Actions.
- Audio Visualizer Tool : CUDA/C++ tool for creating "Monstercat style" audio visualized music videos.
- [Class Backup Website](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Class-Backup-Website) : Self hosted website storing class content backups.
- Discord Bots :
  - [Discorca](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Class-Backup-Website) : Discord Bot for Dispatching Orca Quantum Chemistry simualtions and returning reuslts to and from a Hosted Server sidestepping VPN Requirments
  - [Palworld-Server-Bot](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Palworld-Server-Bot) : Hosts and Controls a Palworld Server through a Discord Server sidestepping SSH and Linux Server Management aspects
  - [Factorio-Server-Bot](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/Factorio-Server-Bot) : Hosts and Controls a Factorio Server through a Discord Server sidestepping SSH and Linux Server Management aspects
- [RocketLeagueReplayParser](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/RocketLeagueReplayParserCLI) : CLI tool that can extract info from Rocket League replays for data/game analysis.
- [FYDP-SunDOG](https://github.com/MrDNAlex/FYDP-SunDOG) : Repository with all Programming related tasks for my FYDP (Fourth Year Design Project) Solar Down Conversion film project
